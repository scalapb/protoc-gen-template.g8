# Giter8 template for ScalaPB plugins

Do you want to write your own proto code generator in Scala? Do you
want to (optionally) integrate it with ScalaPB? This template does exactly
that!

Let's get started!

In a terminal, type:

```
sbt new scalapb/protoc-gen-template.g8
```

Once the project is generated, you will find additional usage instructions in
its top-level README.md file.
